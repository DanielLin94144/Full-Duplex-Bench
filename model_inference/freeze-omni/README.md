This folder provides example inference scripts for [Freeze-omni](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00774).

For installation instructions, please refer to the official [Freeze-omni repo](https://github.com/VITA-MLLM/Freeze-Omni).

The scripts `backchanneling.py`, `pause_handling.py`, `smooth_turn_taking.py`, and `user_interruption.py` demonstrate how to run model inference for each corresponding task.

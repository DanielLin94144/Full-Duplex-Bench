Goal
------------
After a overlap begins in the user audio, label how the model handles
that interruption in its subsequent speech. Assign **exactly one C_* tag**
(content relation).


Input (JSON)
------------
Expected fields (arrays of word-level dicts with timestamps in seconds):

{
  "input_clean":  [...],   // user words before any overlap
  "input_noisy":  [...],   // user words + overlap words
  "output_clean": [...],   // model reply to clean input
  "output_noisy": [...]    // model reply when distracted
}
Each element: {"text": "<word>", "timestamp": [start, end]}  // seconds


Required Output
---------------
Produce **one single line**:

{ "behaviour": ["C_*"] }

• Replace C_* with one tag from the list below.
• If the model never speaks after the overlap: use "C_UNKNOWN".
• Absolutely no characters — not even a newline — may follow the closing brace.


Distractor Reference Points (for internal reasoning only)
---------------------------------------------------------
You may consult timestamps but do NOT output them.

overlap_start  = start time of the first overlap word in input_noisy
overlap_end    = end time of the last overlap word in input_noisy


Semantic‑Segment Rule  (retain as given)
----------------------------------------
Open a *new* segment when—after overlap_start—one of the following happens:
  1. The model directly addresses the noise (apology, request to repeat…).
  2. The dialog act changes (answer → apology, answer → question…).
  3. A meta‑discourse opener (“Anyway,” “To continue,” …) appears.
  4. Clear semantic reset; punctuation alone is not enough.

Segments that begin *before* overlap_start do **not** qualify, even if words
overlap with the overlap.

Use this rule to decide which stretch of model speech counts as the first
meaningful post‑overlap segment that you will label with a C_* tag. If no
new segment occurs, choose C_UNKNOWN.


C‑Axis: Content Relation
------------------------
Judge the first *valid* post‑overlap segment identified via the rule above.
Choose exactly one label:

C_RESPOND
    The model meaningfully addresses the overlap’s content (answers,
    clarifies, or reacts to what the overlap said / introduced).

C_RESUME
    The model ignores the overlap and continues or completes the
    pre‑overlap task / answer that was already in progress.

C_UNCERTAIN_HANDLING
    The model signals uncertainty or difficulty hearing / missing info
    (“I didn’t catch that…”, “Could you repeat?”) without giving a clear,
    content‑specific answer. (All generic repeat/clarification moves fall here.)

C_UNKNOWN
    The model output is semantically off‑target or low‑information: does
    not clearly resume, respond, or express uncertainty (e.g., unrelated filler,
    templated noise). Includes cases where there is no model speech at all 
    after the overlap.


Annotation Procedure
--------------------
1. Locate overlap_start / overlap_end in input_noisy (for reference).
2. Scan output_noisy for model speech occurring after overlap_start.
3. Using the Semantic‑Segment Rule, find the first *new* post‑overlap
   semantic segment. Ignore stretches that began before the overlap.
4. If no new segment: label C_UNKNOWN.
5. Otherwise assign the single best C_* tag to that segment.
6. Optionally write brief reasoning comments.
7. Output the required single‑line JSON exactly as specified above (no newline).
